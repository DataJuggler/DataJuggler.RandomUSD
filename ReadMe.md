DataJuggler.RandomUSD uses C# to open a usda file, and duplicate a prop and randomly position it.
The only tested use this is a snow creator. I am buildiing a blazor site to make this simple to create
snow scenes, and add it to an Omniverse Scene to make it appear to snow.

You can add multiple snow scenes, and there is a property called Settings.AdditionalY, that can be used to add more snow
higher up in a scene, so you can longer duration of snow falling.
